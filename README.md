Good and bad JavaScript code style
==================

Preface
--------------------------------------
 Nowadays there are many libs, frameworks, each of them have their own styles, architecture.  
There is such opinion that good developer should can read any code style and do not pay attention on how it is rewritten.
In fact it is true, but all libs and frameworks are aiming for better code organization, fast perfomance and some other issues.
So in fact every project is oriented to good code.
