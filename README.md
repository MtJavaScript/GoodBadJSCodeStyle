Good and bad JavaScript code style
==================

Preface
--------------------------------------
 What for to write good code  
 1. Less time to understand, fix, extend
 2. Less time means less money to do project.
 3. Less bugs
 4. Flexibility, extesibility, comfortability, readability
 5. Good mood when work with good code
 6. Increase level of team
 7. Increase cost of project by flexibility and exensibility
 8. Elegant code

Let's start
--------------------------------------

###1 - if/for without brackets
Everybody who learnt in University was studied by C/C++ and learned to write code like this.
Many old C/C++ books are full of such code.  
```javascript
//Bad
if(n)
   a = 5;
```
This gives  
1. More bugs easy to do
   If to do new line, which is almost always needed and forget to add brackets than bugs appear  
   that you would search much time.  
2. More time to support and keep in mind do not do bug with new line  
3. A bit decrease readability.  

So write this
```javascript
//Good
if(n){
  a = 5;
}
```
More bad code in this style
```javascript
//Bad
for (key in source)
      if (source[key] !== undefined)
        target[key] = source[key]
```

###2 - where to put spaces
Spaces also can do code or easy or complex

```javascript
//Bad
if (n) {
   a = 5;
}
```

```javascript
//Good
if(n){
   a = 5;
}
```
  
```javascript
//Bad
var o = {
   load:function() {
      
   }
};
```

```javascript
//Good
var o = {
   load: function(){
      
   }
};
```

### 3 - ?: - ternary operator
Try to avoid this operator.  
When developers starts to code they learn this operator and than get habbit to write it instead of ```if```.  
Use ternary operator when there is no way to write over ```if```.  
  
ternary operator does code more complex.

### 4 - if with equation
```javascript
//Bad
if( a = b = this.getName()){

}
```

```javascript
//Good
a = this.getName();
b = a;
if(a){

}
```

Equation in ```if``` does code more complex

### 5 - Many vars

```javascript
//Bad
var a = 5;
var b = 7;
var c = 10;
```

```javascript
//Good
var a = 5,
    b = 7,
    c = 10;
```

Many vars decrease a bit readability of code.  
And does code less elegant.

### 6 - Array on several rows. Style to avoid extra comma.
```javascript
//Bad
var arr = [
   {
      a: 5,
      b: 10
   }
   ,
   {
      a: 10, b: 12
   }
   ];
```

```javascript
//Good
var arr = [{
   a: 5,
   b: 10
},{
   a: 10,
   b: 12
}];
```
There are many repos, especially on node.js with that bad code style.  
This does code not elegant, and complex to read.  

### 7 - new line

```javascript
//Bad
function a(){
  var a = 5;
  console.log(a);
  return a + 5;
}
```
  

```javascript
//Good
function a(){
  var a = 5;
  
  console.log(a);
  
  return a + 5;
}
```

It is needed to do new line after var declaring and before return.  

### 8 - using special chars like ```_,$```

```_``` and ```$``` does very much decrease code readness.
Try to use them only when there is no way without them.  

Almost all developers knows that naming function with _ at means that it is for private.  
But as result code become less readable, so keep it in mind.  
```javascript
//Bad
var $a = 5,
    _b = 6;
    
this._aDoSomething = function(){
   
};

```

### 9 - Naming variables, function, classes.
```javascript
//good
var myVar = 5,
    doSomething = function(){
    
    };
   
var MyClass = function(){

};
```

P.S.:
----------------------------
Many node.js modules and JQuery plugins are written in bad code style.
